## Usage

Use `CountrySelector.page` if you need to show the selector inside a widget that is full screen. If you need to show the selector inside a modal of some sort, use `CountrySelector.sheet` instead.

```dart
Navigator.of(context).push(
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (ctx) => CountrySelector.page(
      onCountrySelected: (country) => Navigator.of(context).pop(country),
    ),
  ),
)
```
## Localization

Use `CountrySelectorLocalization.of(context)?.countryName(isoCode)` when you need to dynamically localize the name of a country.
